# LiCSBAS

LiCSBAS is an open-source package in Python and bash to carry out InSAR time series analysis primarily using LiCSAR products
(at least interferograms and coherence maps) which are freely available on the [COMET-LiCS web portal](https://comet.nerc.ac.uk/COMET-LiCS-portal/).    

It was originally developed by Dr. Yu Morishita during his research visit stay at the University of Leeds and is currently maintained by the COMET team
while his original version (and other tools) exists at his [original site](https://github.com/yumorishita).  

Here we try keep a unity and ingest new functionality to this version that contains various updates but a lot of experimental functions that were
developed within a programming learning curve of several COMET members.  

With LiCSBAS, users can easily derive the time series and velocity of the displacement if sufficient LiCSAR products are available in the area of interest.
LiCSBAS also contains visualization tools to interactively display the time series of displacement to help investigation and interpretation of the results.

## Documentation and Bug Reports

If you have found an issue or bug using the main branch, please report it on the [issues page](https://github.com/comet-licsar/LiCSBAS/issues).

We assume users are familiar with the standard installation procedure of Github repositories, therefore we do not adapt the original [**wiki**](https://github.com/yumorishita/LiCSBAS/wiki) pages that document well all the originally implemented procedures by Dr. Yu Morishita, 
including the installation procedure (if you follow this procedure, please be aware of the different repository URL, this version of LiCSBAS resides at [github.com/comet-licsar/licsbas](https://github.com/comet-licsar/licsbas) while the original wiki refers to the discontinued [github.com/yumorishita/licsbas](https://github.com/yumorishita/licsbas)).

Similarly, the original [quick start](https://github.com/yumorishita/LiCSBAS/wiki/2_0_workflow#quick-start) describes processing philosophy that we keep in our version and only further maintain and develop.  

We keep regular release strategy of 1-2 releases per year.
The 'main' branch is considered stable and relatively up-to-date (if the main branch contains bug, please report it to us).
The 'dev' branch is considered testing and can contain routine bugs that are usually fast-resolved by our team.  

Besides those branches, there are several forks existing, maintained by current or previous COMET members.
Although we incorporate most of their precious scripts, extending functionality of LiCSBAS,
these can include original approaches not present or documented here (yet).  

For example, Dr. Qi Ou prepared optional steps as LiCSBAS1xx scripts and [provided documentation](https://github.com/qi-ou/LiCSBAS/blob/main/README.md) on their use,
as she worked her way to her [article on Tian Shan](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-7529996/v1).

## Sample Products and Tutorial

The latest tutorial is available as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/comet-licsar/LiCSBAS/blob/main/licsbas_tutorial.ipynb) that you can directly
[run using Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/comet-licsar/LiCSBAS/HEAD?labpath=licsbas_tutorial.ipynb), or you can test the [dev branch version](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/comet-licsar/LiCSBAS/dev?labpath=licsbas_tutorial.ipynb) that contains latest updates.  

Furthermore, if you have Google account, you can use Google Colab:  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/comet-licsar/LiCSBAS/blob/main/licsbas_tutorial.ipynb)  

The tutorial still uses the original LiCSBAS tutorial data that can be downloaded separately if needed, including the sample scripts for learning outside of the notebook, that is:

- Time: 2016/09/09-2018/05/08 (~1.7 years, 67 epochs, ~217 interferograms)
